# Demonstrate how to deploy OpenAM to Kubernetes from a Jenkins CI pipeline 

##Warning

**This code is not supported by ForgeRock and it is your responsibility to verify that the software is suitable and safe for use.**

Largely inspired by https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/continuous-deployment-on-kubernetes 


# Overview 

This project includes a Jenkins file which contains instructions on how to build an OpenAM image, push the image to 
a private repo (in this case, gcr.io) and deploy it to a Kubernetes cluster. 

To use this you need:
* Jenkins CI (version 2.x - as it needs the pipeline feature and multi branch builds)
* docker and kubectl need to be available to Jenkins as it will use these commands to build and deploy images 
* Access to the OpenAM base image (openam-onbuild). See https://stash.forgerock.org/projects/DOCKER/repos/docker/browse

The workflow is:
* A branch is created to test a feature. The OpenAM configuration is created in OpenAM/config
* When the branch is pushed, Jenkins will pick it up and start to run the pipeline defined in ./Jenkinsfile
* The pipeline creates a new child image which is fully configured according to the new configuration
* The image is pushed to the repo (gcr.io)
* A new Kubernetes namespace is created to host the image. Each branch maps to a new namespace. This keeps different branches
isolated in the cluster. This will allow several versions to be concurrently tested.
* kubectl commands are issued to push the new image to Kubernetes. If an old image already exists, it will be replaced by
the new image (K8s deployments are used and will do a rolling update)
* The "production" namespace is treated as special. It will cause a load balancer ingress to be created so
that the image becomes reachable from outside the cluster. 
* To reach all other namespace instances you can use kubectl port-forward to forward a local laptop port
to the cluster.  For example:

```
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
kubectl port-forward --namespace=test openam-d86gh7 8080:8080
```


# Git branching model

The branching model is:
* master is the current development branch
* production represents production (treated as special by the Jenkins deployment)
* Any other branch is treated like a test branch

There is a "canary" branch concept (currently not working) but the eventual intent is to 
replace one of N instances in production with a canary container.
