# Ingress for our components
# Note that the nginx ingress path /foo matches /foo, /foo/bar etc.
# To get the equivalent on GCE ingress you need two rules /foo and /foo/*
# Nginx seems OK to ignore the extra *
#
# NOTE: The openidm ingress does not work right now on GCE
# The default health checker requires a 200 response on the / URL of the app
# but openidm is not configured with anything on / (selfservice is moved to /idmselfservice)
# The manual workaround is to edit the GCE compute health check and change the
# Test URL to /idmselfservice

# Unless you want to use hostname based ingress, it is better to leave the
# Hostname out so it works for all incoming hosts
# If you are forwarding from another load balancer, make
# sure the LB sets the appropiate X-forwarded headers
